                <p>Interactive white boards are used for classroom teaching and involve students to learn with technology.<b>  Notes, flowcharts, drawings and PPTs </b>used in the course of teaching are saved to be accessed as and when required. Students are actively involved in their learning through presentations made by them using the whiteboards.</p>
                <p>The goal of a <b>language lab is to engage students to effectively take an interest in language learning practices </b>and get more practice than generally plausible in a conventional classroom condition.With a language lab, all students in the class can speak simultaneously without distracting each other regardless of the class size. Language lab gives an opportunity to work on individual needs, which at times is not addressed in a classroom setting. It helps strengthen the basics of the language.</p>
                <p>Children learn enthusiastically with a <b> state-of-the-art audio-visual equipment</b> to aid in imparting language skills.
                    At primary level, kids are monitored by the language teacher for better understanding whereas children of higher classes are mature enough to enhance and widen their knowledge without being supervised by their teachers.
                    The Lab is effectively utilized by students and faculty members for various self-enhancement and soft skill development activities.</p>
